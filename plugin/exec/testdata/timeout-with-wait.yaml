name: timeout-with-wait
description: a scenario that waits and the wait time should not be included in the timeout
tests:
  - exec: sleep .50
    wait:
      # The timeout should NOT fire because sleep .50 should be the only thing
      # that is accounted for in the timeout, not the wait.before
      before: .5s
    timeout:
      after: 1s
